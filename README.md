# define-define

Source code for the `define-define` protocol, our submission to the Fall 2019 [Aesthetics of Prosthetics](https://www.prostheticsexhibition.com/) exhibition.

Under active development in preparation for the September opening.

- Run `docker-compose up`

## Abstract

We, the designers, have devised a protocol for the creation of some pair of objects.

Where Sol LeWitt was so obsessed with abdicating control over outcome, we believe that the ever-present threat of machine intelligence asks us to maintain a greater degree of responsibility. Participation, as virtuous as it may seem, is a red herring. Machine programming languages offer us the opportunity to explicitly define our intent. Alexander and Price were correct to identify this as a chance to expose sites of user input; they were incorrect to step away.

In this game, users are provided with a drawing-as-interface: we have drawn and displayed a static simulation of our protocol. The project exists in the interactive projected overlay. We have translated our intent to a machine system, hosted on the internet.  The users are asked to visit a website from their phone. It displays the instructions of our protocol and allows the user to define the language within. For example, the predicate “create a non-vertical line” prompts a user to define (through drawing) what they understand to be a non-vertical line. A projector will display the output of this system on the canvas to create a palimpsest of divergence and error in realtime.

We defer specificity in language, not action. We define define.

We aim to find a means to marry indeterminate outcome with a high degree of designer responsibility and control. This collective language prosthetic is one attempt. We believe, as designers, that our future relationship with machine intelligence will be defined by this paradox.
